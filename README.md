- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sanskarie
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Astronomy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Harvard's cs50 via edX and Responsive web design from freecodecamp.org
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects, python libraries (especially for astronomy), and any project which could help me learn and connect more.
- 📫 Reach me at sanskarvashishtha92851@gmail.com
